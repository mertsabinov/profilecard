import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
apiKey: "",
authDomain: "",
projectId: "",
storageBucket: "",
messagingSenderId: "",
appId: "",
measurementId: "",
};

initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const db = getFirestore();
export const auth = getAuth();

This is a snippet of code that initializes a Firebase app using the provided configuration object, and then exports two objects: "db" which is a reference to the Firestore database and "auth" which is a reference to the Firebase Authentication service. The configuration object, "firebaseConfig", is missing the actual values for apiKey, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, appId, and measurementId, and should be replaced with the appropriate values from your Firebase project.
